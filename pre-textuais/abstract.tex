 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
  The new projects in robotics have demanded more and more processing power, consequently, they require greater energy efficiency, especially in applications that make use of batteries. In this way, the use of the FPGA can contribute to a gain in processing power associated with low consumption. In this work, a method was developed to establish communication between the ROS and an FPGA embedded in a SoC of the Cyclone V family. Through a server-client system, through a Gigabit ethernet link, it was possible to establish communication between the elements of the system. Performance tests were performed on the DE10-Nano development kit and reached a result considered acceptable.
